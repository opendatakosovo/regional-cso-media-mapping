## What Is This?
A regional mapping of CSO and Media organizations. The CSOs that are included in this mapping should be involved in Good Governance, Transparency, and Accountability.

## Prerequisites
1. Nodejs
2. Grunt
3. Bower

## Get Started
1. In your Terminal, cd into the project's directory. Run "bower update" and "grunt init".
2. Still in your Terminal, run a simple server: e.g. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
3. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8000/
4. Voila.

## Adding New Dependencies
Manage front-end dependencies with bower.json and the "bower update" command.
Manage other dependencies in package.json and with the "npm install" command.

## Build The App
The project uses grunt as the task manager to build the app.
Run "grunt init" to initialize the app from scratch.
Just run "grunt" to update it.

## Updating Template and Javascript Files
Any changes inside the 'app' folders will require the default "grunt" command to be executed.
